# test_automation


To run this project write this command in the terminal: pytest -s -v python_automation

This project I built does basic computational operations on a web table In automation.

The project was built in several hours, and is a basic model for large systems.

In order to develop the project and expand it I would add a report to external files,

Adds photos and screenshots when falling,

And extends the running options to more browsers.

Thank you
